### Description

As a **Python Developer** specializing in Simulation **Frameworks, UI Development**, and **Machine Learning**, I contributed to building advanced systems for demand-driven environments and predictive modeling. My work focused on enhancing supply chain management tools, developing user-friendly interfaces, and creating machine learning models to improve forecasting and decision-making processes.

I designed and implemented an improved User Interface (**UI**) for **DDMRP** (Demand-Driven Material Requirements Planning) and **MRP** (Material Requirements Planning) engines, optimizing usability and operational efficiency in supply chain systems. Leveraging **Flask**, I built a dynamic web application to display, edit, and manage input values for simulation engines, including **WMAPE, DDMRP, and MRP, enabling real-time updates** and **streamlined data handling**.

To standardize and accelerate development, I developed custom reusable User Controls in Flask, ensuring consistent and efficient design across multiple screens. I also architected key components such as the Data Access Layer (**DAL**) and Business Logic Layer (**BLL**), ensuring robust backend architecture and seamless data flow.

In the domain of security and **authentication**, I implemented secure user sign-in and sign-up mechanisms, integrating third-party authentication providers like **Google** and **Microsoft** to enhance application security. Additionally, I developed a WMAPE automatic error identification system, incorporating heatmap graphs to provide intuitive visual diagnostics for demand generator engines.

I also contributed to machine learning model development, building models for time series data generation and future demand prediction. By utilizing algorithms such as **Random Forest, Isolation Forest**, and **LSTM** neural networks, I improved forecasting accuracy and reliability in dynamic demand environments.

Through performance optimization and troubleshooting, I ensured seamless operation and an enhanced user experience across all modules. My technical expertise in UI development, backend architecture, and machine learning enabled me to deliver impactful solutions for simulation frameworks and demand-driven applications.
