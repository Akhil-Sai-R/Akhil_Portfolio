### Description
As a **Software Developer and Research Engineer** specializing in**Generative AI, AI, and Machine Learning** at **ASTRIAL GmbH**, I have spearheaded the development of a **co-pilot** designed to analyze security alerts, reduce false positives, and prioritize alarms, streamlining workflows for less-experienced security personnel.

My responsibilities included extensive TTP data preprocessing, where I rephrased and shortened sentences to preserve their original meaning, enhancing model comprehension. Leveraging **SecureBERT**, I handled domain-specific terms to improve the detection and understanding of complex technical concepts in **cybersecurity** data. Additionally, I utilized **GPT-3.5** to rephrase sentences, ensuring readability, diversity, and clarity while maintaining their core intent.

To enable intuitive threat analysis, I integrated preprocessed TTP data into Neo4j, visualizing TTPs and SubTTPs along with their relationships. Further, I incorporated Llama2 with the **Neo4j GraphDatabase**, empowering the **co-pilot** to guide users in navigating complex security datasets and identifying techniques and tactics effectively.

My expertise spans deep learning models such as **BERT, GPT, T5**, and **OpenAI APIs**, applied to tasks like text classification, summarization, and question-answering. I have fine-tuned **LLMs** (e.g., Llama2, GPT) for domain-specific applications, applied prompt engineering to optimize LLM outputs, and implemented cosine similarity and vector embeddings for tasks like **Named Entity Recognition** (NER) and semantic search.

In addition to my NLP expertise, I have delivered end-to-end **image processing** solutions, including data acquisition, preprocessing, model training, and deployment. I enhanced **object detection** and **segmentation** algorithms using tools like **YoloV5, OpenCV**, and **SAM** (Segment Anything Model) while optimizing models for edge device deployments with **ONNX** and **OpenVINO**.

Further accomplishments include designing **sound detection** algorithms using **FFT** and **geo-localization** techniques, applying advanced **audio preprocessing** for signal quality optimization, and deploying applications with **Docker-based CI/CD pipelines** for scalable, reliable delivery. My focus on model robustness and data optimization techniques has ensured consistent, high-quality outputs.

I also contributed to team development by mentoring **interns** and **masterâ€™s students**, fostering technical excellence and collaborative learning. Through a combination of technical innovation and mentorship, I have driven impactful solutions in **AI-powered cybersecurity, computer vision**, and **generative AI**.
