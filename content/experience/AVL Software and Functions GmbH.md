## Description

As a **Junior Software Developer** (Intern) specializing in **AI, ML**, and **Robotics**, I played a pivotal role in designing and developing a prototype **smart rover** named as **MOWME**, leveraging AI, ML, and DL technologies to enable autonomous operations. The rover was equipped with **SLAM** (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) capabilities and utilized CNN networks for task identification and classification. I integrated advanced features such as **object detection**, **obstacle avoidance**, **GPS** waypoint generation, and self-testing mechanisms, achieving seamless autonomous navigation.

To ensure high-quality datasets, I built **automated data preprocessing pipelines**, incorporating steps like **Normalization, Standardization, Resizing, Denoising, Segmentation**, and **Morphology**, as well as JSON creation and Data Pickling for efficient data handling. These pipelines enabled consistent and reliable input data for machine learning workflows.

In the domain of **Machine Learning and Model Optimization**, I implemented Regression, Classification, and Ensemble algorithms, troubleshooting bottlenecks to enhance model accuracy and reduce inference latency. Optimized models were deployed on edge devices such as **Raspberry Pi 3**, **Jetson Nano**, and **AWS EC2 GPU instances**, leveraging GPU acceleration with tools like **CUDA** and **cuDNN** for efficient performance.

Additionally, I integrated **IoT devices** like **TCG4** sensors and **Beacon** devices to collect metrics (e.g., acceleration, pressure, temperature, humidity) and established cloud communication pipelines with **AWS**. I worked with advanced communication protocols including **SOMEIP**, **VSOMEIP**, and **CAN** to ensure robust and stable device connectivity.

My contributions also included designing and developing a **web-based AI model development platform**, enabling users to build **image-based AI models** for **object detection, classification**, and **recognition** without requiring programming expertise.

Through effective **CI/CD** pipeline management and version control systems like **GitHub** and **GitLab**, I ensured streamlined workflows, reliable deployments, and system scalability. My work combined technical expertise and innovation to deliver a versatile smart rover and empower users with accessible **AI-driven** solutions.
