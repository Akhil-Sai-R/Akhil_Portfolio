### Description

As a Software Design and Developer Engineer at **Tech Mahindra LTD**, I worked extensively on designing, developing, and deploying software solutions leveraging technologies like Python, AWS, .NET, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Microsoft Azure Cloud. My role involved **automation, responsive web design, cloud infrastructure management**, and **enhancing application performance** for seamless operations.

I automated Azure resource creation using PowerShell scripts, managing resource groups, web applications, storage blobs/tables, and firewall rules to optimize cloud deployment processes. Additionally, I developed responsive web designs (**RWD**) using **Media Queries, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS**, and **JavaScript**, ensuring cross-device compatibility and delivering consistent user experiences across platforms.

In application development and deployment, I configured and managed **IIS** Web Servers for hosting and collaborated in system specification meetings to align development with user requirements. I designed and implemented **CI/CD** pipelines using **AWS CodePipeline, CodeCommit**, and **CodeDeploy**, streamlining continuous integration and delivery for efficient software deployment.

My expertise extended to cloud infrastructure management, where I deployed and maintained **Azure IaaS virtual machines** (VMs), **PaaS role instances**, and **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** environments, ensuring scalable and reliable infrastructure. I also managed version control systems using **GIT, GitHub**, and **TFS**, employing structured branching strategies to maintain codebase integrity and foster collaboration.

As part of technical troubleshooting, I diagnosed and resolved application performance issues, verified data integrity, and identified code defects. I implemented SSO policies and federated identities, managing dynamic group memberships and user access policies across multiple SaaS applications to enhance security and identity management.

Furthermore, I collaborated on database functionalities, data analytics, and reporting requirements, ensuring alignment with organizational objectives. My comprehensive skill set in software development, cloud automation, and infrastructure management enabled me to deliver high-impact solutions for enterprise-grade applications.
