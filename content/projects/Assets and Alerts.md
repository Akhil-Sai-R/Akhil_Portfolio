## Description

This project focuses on developing an **intelligent Assets and Alerts Copilot system** that leverages graph-based data modeling and AI-powered insights to provide a comprehensive cybersecurity solution. The system integrates advanced tools like **Neo4j**, **Mistral**, and **Streamlit** to enable real-time asset and alert detection, relationship mapping, and contextual analysis.

The **graph-based data modeling** ensures accurate visualization of assets, products, vulnerabilities, and their relationships, providing unparalleled clarity in understanding interconnected cybersecurity risks. With the **Mistral LLM**, the copilot allows users to interact using natural language queries, transforming complex data into actionable insights.

The system provides **real-time responses** to queries, dynamic alert prioritization, and customizable visualizations of vulnerabilities and asset connections. It is particularly valuable for security teams seeking to reduce alert fatigue, understand critical relationships, and prioritize actionable insights.

This project represents a **cutting-edge approach to cybersecurity operations**, combining advanced AI with graph-driven analysis to enhance threat detection, incident response, and asset management.
